## 0.0.3
***I finally released it on GitHub***
### Added
- NMS related configuration settings
- Minecraft version regex system
### Modified
- Changed the Module system
- Changed the package name from `io.github.dolphin2410.gemmyLib` to `io.github.teamcheeze.plum` as well as the maven groupId name
### Finished
- I finished migrating all clientity features to another project called PlumJuice

## 0.0.2
### Notes
- Preparing to move NMS modules outside this library, and create a separate module that handles it.
### Added
- The Serializer class os created, and it easily serializes in the pattern `<class_name>;<param_0>;<param_1>;<param_n>`
### Removed
- The nms module has been removed from the project.
### In maintenance [Not recommended to use now]
- The clientity and some classes might not have been removed from the project completely. I'll do my best to remove all of them.
### Pre-Release
- The module that contains the clientity feature will be found in my github repository soon

## 0.0.1
